  # On Linux, we only need auditwheel to add the tags to the wheel.
  # Unfortunately, auditwheel currently requires us to repair the wheel to
  # add the tags, even though we do not need to repair the wheel.
  # Thus, we need to set everything up for a wheel repair (including placing
  # the VTK libraries in `vtkmodules`, where they are expected to be at
  # runtime), perform the wheel repair, and then remove the added libraries.
  # Then the tags will have been added.
